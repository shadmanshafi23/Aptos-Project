# Asset Tracking Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Asset Tracking** smart contract enables the registration and transfer of tokenized assets on the Aptos blockchain. It aims to provide a transparent and secure way to manage asset ownership, ensuring that asset details and ownership history are accurately recorded and accessible.

## Features

- **Register Asset**:

  - Allows users to register a new asset by providing its name and associating it with the current owner’s address.
  - Each asset is uniquely identified and linked to its owner.

- **Transfer Asset**:
  - Enables the current owner to transfer ownership of the asset to a new address.
  - Updates the asset’s owner information to reflect the new owner.

## Future Scope

1. **Asset Metadata**:

   - Extend asset registration to include additional metadata such as description, value, or other relevant details.

2. **Ownership History**:

   - Implement functionality to track and view the complete ownership history of each asset.

3. **Asset Verification**:

   - Introduce mechanisms for verifying the authenticity and validity of asset registrations.

4. **Asset Transfer Security**:

   - Add security measures such as authorization checks or multi-signature requirements for asset transfers.

5. **Asset Valuation**:

   - Integrate features for updating and tracking asset valuations over time.

6. **Asset Marketplace**:
   - Develop a marketplace for buying, selling, or auctioning assets, leveraging the asset tracking system.

The **Asset Tracking** contract aims to simplify and secure asset management, providing a foundational tool for asset-related applications on the Aptos blockchain.
